# Time-Series
Time Series for Sales 


**Data**

The data consists in Alcohol sales from 1992 to 2019 taken monthly. The dataset is no longer available at the UCI repository. However, it is still downloadable at kaggle:

At that link there are more datasets than the one analyzed in this repository. I will be working on the *Alcohol_sales.csv*


**Scope**

The **objective** is to perform a forecasting on the sales data. To do so, I will implement several models from AutoRegressive and Moving Average to more advanced models, all while explaining a little bit of the foundations without diving in too deep.
