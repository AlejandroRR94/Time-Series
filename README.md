# Time-Series
Time Series for Sales 


## **Data**

The data consists in Alcohol sales from 1992 to 2019 taken monthly. The dataset is no longer available at the UCI repository. However, it is still downloadable at kaggle:

At that link there are more datasets than the two analyzed in this repository. I will be working with the *Alcohol_sales.csv* and the *BeerWineLiquor.csv*


## **Scope**

The **objective** is to perform a forecasting on the sales data. To do so, I will implement several models from AutoRegressive and Moving Average to more advanced models, all while explaining a little bit of the foundations without diving in too deep.

## Notebooks

There are two notebooks.

- **Alcohol Time Series**  explains a little bit more each algorithm used.
- **BeerWineLiquor**  is a more rapid-fire implementation of the algorithms needed in order to accurately forecast the series in case you just want to look up the necessary steps to make a forecast.
